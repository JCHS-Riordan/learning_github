What, you are stepping westward?
Yea. ‘twould be a wildish destiny, 
if we who thus together roam
in a strange land and far from home
were in this place the guests of chance
yet who would stop or fear to advance
though home or shelter he had none,
with such a sky to lead him on?

The dewy ground was dark and cold,
behind all gloomy to behold
and stepping westward seemed to be
a kind of heavnly destiny
